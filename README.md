#ptap

ptap (pronounced pee-tap) is a psychophysics platform that can run in-lab and Amazon Mechanical Turk experiments. It is a former branch of mkturk (built originally by E. Issa while at MIT). 

It is designed to be an easy-to-install, one-stop shop for writing screen-based behavioral tasks and collecting data from in-lab machines and Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

The guiding principles are: 

* Modularity  
* Task expressivity 
* Use of static content
