//================== INITIALIZE GLOBALS ==================//
// In the interest of code readability and spaghetti-minimization, the use of globals should be kept to a minimum, and instead explicit passage of variables into and out of functions is encouraged.
// For certain things, globals make sense and may even be required, like event listeners and async processes.
